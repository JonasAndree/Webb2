		<!-- HTML5 introduced a method to let web designers take control over the viewport, through the <meta> tag.
		     The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. It varies with the device, 
		     and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen. 
		     You should include the following <meta> viewport element in all your web pages:
		     -->
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
		
		<!-- CSS In this course you have to order your styling in a separate stylesheet file (css in a css folder). -->
